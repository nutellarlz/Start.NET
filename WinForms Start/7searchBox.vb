' This is what remains of the first iteration of the Start.NET Start Menu...
' I was first developing it using WinForms which I now see was a mistake...
' If someone want's to pick up where I left off, what's wrong with you?
' Also, this can be done.  It actually may be relatively easy to finish the
' legacy WinForms SDN Start Menu, but I think it will be a fruitless endevour
' as the WPF version has far mor potential in my opinion.  Nevertheless, I
' shall not be the one to stop you from expending your own energy on this.  I
' commend you for your spirit.  I wish you the best.
